Variations Radio Buttons for WooCommerce. Let your customers choose product variations using radio buttons instead of dropdowns.

== Description ==

Radio buttons are more friendly than dropdown selects. This plugin will help you have a better UX in your WooCommerce site, as your customers will see all your variations without having to click on a dropdown.

The radio buttons will be toggled dinamically so your customers won't be able to choose non existent variations.
